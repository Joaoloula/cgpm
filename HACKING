Notes For Anyone Hacking gpmcc

* Branches

Should be [month][day]-[username]-[branch-description...], for example a
well named branch is 1226-fsaad-dist-sampling.

Please do not delete branches, history should be maintained.

* Python coding style

Generally follow PEP 8, with these exceptions:

- Single line between top-level definitions.
  => Two blank lines are needlessly verbose.
- Four spaces, instead of alignment, for continuation lines.
  => Using alignment penalizes descriptive function names and renaming.

- Prefer single-quoted strings, except use """ for docstrings.
