Notes For Anyone Hacking gpmcc

* Branches

Should be [month][day]-[username]-[branch-description...], for example a
well named branch is 1226-fsaad-dist-sampling.

Please do not delete branches, history should be maintained.

* Python coding style

Generally follow PEP 8, with these exceptions:

- Single line between top-level definitions.
  => Two blank lines are needlessly verbose.
- Four spaces, instead of alignment, for continuation lines.
  => Using alignment penalizes descriptive function names and renaming.

- Prefer single-quoted strings, except use """ for docstrings.

* Python imports

Should be organized as follows:

    [Standard library imports]
    - blank line -
    [Third party library imports]
    - blank line -
    [Sister projects library imports]
    - blank line -
    [gpmcc module imports]

Each import block should be organized alphabetically, first all unqualified
imports (import baz), then all named imports (from foo import nix).
For example

import math
import multiprocessing as mp
from array import ArrayType
from struct import pack

import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import geom, norm, laplace
... etc ...

* Testing

Before pushing any changes, run check.sh.
